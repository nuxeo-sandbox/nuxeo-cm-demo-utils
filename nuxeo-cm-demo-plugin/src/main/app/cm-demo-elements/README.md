Polymer components for the Case Management demo.


## Dependencies

Install Node.js (I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the elements' dependencies:

    bower install


## Demo and Docs

Use [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve). You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve -p 3000

Polyserve will provide a URL with which you can access the docs and demos.
